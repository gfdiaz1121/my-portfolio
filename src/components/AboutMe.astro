    I specialize in building robust automation and test systems that seamlessly integrate embedded <strong>hardware, robotics,</strong> and <strong>software</strong> to optimize <strong>manufacturing processes</strong>. 
    My work includes developing <strong>multi-threaded VB.NET</strong>  applications for parallel <strong>BLE testing</strong>, designing <strong>Angular dashboards</strong> that visualize real-time production data through <strong>.NET APIs </strong> 
    and complex <strong>SQL Server queries</strong>, and crafting <strong>C#</strong> based tools for <strong>serial</strong> and <strong>TCP/IP</strong>  communication with embedded devices. 

    </p>

    <p>
        Iâ€™ve implemented secure, scalable workflows using AWS CLI and custom scripts to manage cloud environment synchronization, and I maintain a strong focus on software-hardware interaction stability. 
    Additionally, I develop cross-platform mobile applications that communicate with embedded hardware over BLE, TCP, and USB, ensuring consistent performance and backend integration. 
    </p>

    <p>
       My skill set combines device interfacing, full-stack development, and deep database expertise to deliver efficient, reliable, and scalable solutions tailored to high-demand production environments.
